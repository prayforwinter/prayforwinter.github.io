  <p>I decided today that I wanted to write again—it had been a long time. My latest journal has "July 2014 - " inscribed on the inside cover, and I most likely will finish that this week. So it will say: "July 2014 - Aprl 2022." Eight fucking years—isn't that insane?</p>
  <p>So, enough. I have to write more.</p>
  <p>So welcome, come on in for the bullshit.</p>
